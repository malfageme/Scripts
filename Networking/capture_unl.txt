For registering the new script it is necessary to create a new file on the directory

   .local/share/applications/

for example:

   .local/share/applications/capture_unl.desktop

and then register the new mime-type with:

    $ xdg-mime default capture_unl.desktop x-scheme-handler/capture

Lets not forget to check that the script have execution permit enabled or we will obtain this not very insightful message:

    $ xdg-open capture:172.16.132.129/vunl_12_3gvfs-open: capture:172.16.132.129/vunl_12_3: error opening location: The specified location is not supported

One detail is that the script will open a xterm asking for the password of the root user on the VM. The default password is "unl". We can configure the login process with a public key so it is not necessary to enter this pass every time we want to run a capture, but I prefer this way just in case I select a wrong link. At least I can cancel before mi laptop launches another wireshark.
